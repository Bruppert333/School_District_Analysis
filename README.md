 What I found throughtout this analysis is that Charter schools tend to have better scores that public schools. The last table shown, public schools had a better math average than charter schools. It makes you wonder if Charter schools push so hard that by the time they are in their senior year they quit trying as hard. Another discovery I found is that there are several ways to input your code to see the same result. I'm sure my code isn't perfect, or the most efficient but I was able to find everything asked in the challenge. I thought it was interesting that the public schools had a higher budget that the charter schools. Regarding the previous comment, I think another analysis to run would be how many students were at the public schools and charter schools to see if that is why the public school budget is higher.
